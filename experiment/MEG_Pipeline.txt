----------------
Before:

* Setup lab
	* Projctor on
	* Transfer files / PTBWrapper
	* Connect eye tracker
	* Set diode [Run experiment]
	* Response keys out
	* EGI connector on table
	* Test EGI cap
	* Turn on amp
	* BNC from 4 to Misc 4
	* Camera on
	* EGI sync from 8 out

* Test eyetracker
	- Turn on eyelink
	- Check settings
		- Long range mount
		- Right eye
	- Run ET_Calibrate

[If needed: 	- Measure subject's head before Dr. visit
		- (30 min. before)
	- Get appropriate cap
		- In EEG room cabinet
		- No metal
	- Get tub, and NaCl
	- Two small pippettes as well
	- Soak cap in 2'' of NaCl for at least five minutes
		- Microwave solution first to be warmer
	- Plug cap in to test triggers]

* Test experiment
	- Turn on acquisition
	- Load project
	- Load settings
	- Check space on Mac
	- Open NetStation
		- Check for 128
	- Record on MEG
	- Generate stim lists
		- Check encoding
	- Set run 1 going
	- Look for:
		- EEG trigger (if net plugged in)
		- MEG trigger
		- Diode 
	- Check MEG responses are recorded
	- Run GetETFile
		- Check for MEG trigger in .asc file

* Prepare
	- Remove EGI cap
	- Set all to no debugging
	* Check / fix MEG sensors
		- Check acquisition settings
		- Go!
		- Reset all
		- Restart beforehand
		- Gantry position upright
			- If bad
			- Heat
			- Reset all
		- Else
			- Mode > Tune
			- xy
		- If noise everywhere
			- Uncheck maxshield
			- Find / fix bad sensor
			- recheck maxshield

----------------
During:

* Instructions
	- Blink after response, if possible
 
* EEG
	- To put on
		- Hand subject connector on their left shoulder
		- Stretch from behind the subject
		- Pull down ears
		- Make sure plastic is connected in front (like a mask)
		- Measure placement
			- Cz should be equidistant between periculars
				[Also, subjects will put their finger in the middle of the head if asked]
			- FP1, 2 should be 10% of distance between naision and bone at back of head
				- Also aligned equidistant from the mid-line

* Digitization
	- HPI coils attached to electrodes
		- Two in front, two in back
		- At about hairline height
		- ** Do not make symmetrical
	- Attach glasses
		- Tighten to hold in place
	- Digitize
		- Open Acquisition
		- Load project
		- Load settings
		- Load subject
			- Last: initials
			- First: Numbers
		- Hit ‘Change’ on HPI alignment
		- Hit ‘Coordinate system alignment’
		- Reference points
			- LPA, nasion, RPA
		- HPI: In any order
		- Digitize head
			- Outside of EGI
		- When done, click away from head
		- Save preparation

* In MSR
	- Connect HPI on left (facing)
		- Careful of connector
	- EGI connector by door
		- Put on table to hold weight
	- Connect electrodes on right
	* Impedence check
		- Open EGI program on mac
		- Open session ‘2011_MEG_EGI_1k’
		- Hit ‘Measure net impedence’
		- Switch displays
		- Use pipette to put saline solution under bad electrodes
		- Save impedence when done
	- Raise subject
	- Hand response keys
	- Focus eyetracker camera
		- Run the track program to see
	- Set diode
		- Run practice to see where

* Recheck sensors

* Run
	- Load subject preparation
	- HPI measurement before each block
	- Restart EGI after each recording
	- Hit Record Raw on the MEG

--------------------------
After

* Get ET files
	- Test conversion of edf files
	- Transfer log, stim, edf, asc
	
* From EEG
	- Convert files
	- Transfer 

* See website checklist

* EEG
	- Clean electrodes
	- Put EGI cap under running water for 15 min. 
		- Should soak in disinfectant solution (1:10 with water)	
	- Hang back in cabinet
	- Paper towel below to catch water

* Fill out subject start / end time
* Fill out log book
