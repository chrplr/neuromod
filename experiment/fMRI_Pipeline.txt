Practice: Full (30 trials => 8x30 = 4min)
Run: 96*8 = 12.8min (512 (~ 520) TRs)
Localizer: 28.6*16 = 7.6min (306 (~310) TRs)
FOV: 192
TE: 32
TR: 1500

--------------------
* Before

* Login: inserm; inserm

* Turn on monitor
	- Check the settings of the monitor (1024x768; 60Hz)
	- Click Epson Net-Panel
	- Click 'Local Search'
	- Select projector (VIEDEOEMP83003T)
	- 'Power on'

* Test eyetracker
	- Plug in eyetracker
	- Activate local network 3 on stim computer
	- Turn on eyelink computer
	- Settings
		- Long Range
		- Left eye
	- Run calibration (check display, etc.)

* Test advance
	- Run structural
	- Hit TTL to continue

* Test experiment
	- Generate stim lists
		- Check encoding
	- Run with no debugging
	- Test responses
		- Hit TTL during response
		- Both response keys
		- Time out
		- Both response keys in lab	
	- Transfer ET file
		- Convert to asc
		- Check for trigger

* Prepare 
	- All is_debugging = 0;
	- run_num = 1
	- Subject settings
		- Resp type
		- Localizer run
	- TTL 
		- Switch on bottom should be down
		- Switch on top should be to the left
		

--------------------
During

* Run practice
	- Set subject id
	- Evaluate top cell
	- Create practice lists
	- Run practice

* Instructions
	- Cannot see feedback during task
	- Will be longer pauses at times
	- Four blocks
	- Localizer instructions

* Open 'Track' program on stim computer

* Setup Eyetracker 
	- Position eyetracker in scanner
	- Make sure eyelink mirror used in scanner
	- Focus on eye
	- Outside, adjust thresholds until good

* Setup monitor
	- Ask if need to adjust height (Using Epson Net-Panel)

* Test response keys
	- Ask to press both, check matlab prompt

* Calibrate eyetracker

* Run structural

* Create stimuli lists

* Perform each run (Remember to increment run_num!)

* Run localizer

* Run baseline


--------------------
After

* Get the eyetracker files
	- Test conversion

* Copy Subject files to USB (eyetracker, log, data, stim)

* Close eyetracker
	- Run final cell
	- Deactivate local network 3
	- Power off eyelink

* Turn off monitor
	- 'Epson Net-Panel'
	- 'Local Search'
	- Select projector (VIEDEOEMP83003T)
	- 'Power off'

* Log out of computer
* Turn off lights
